Factorial Calculator in Python
This is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

How It Works
The program defines a recursive function factorial(n), which calculates the factorial of a number.
The main() function prompts the user to enter a number and prints the factorial result.
The script runs when executed as the main module (__name__ == "__main__").
